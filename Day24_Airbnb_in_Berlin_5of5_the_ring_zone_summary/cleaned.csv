Paolo has almost 30 years experience in hotel business and loves photography and to create objects out of recycled materials, especially lamps and everything that has to do with light. We are proudly fitting our properties with some of his works.

We are both a bit vintage: reading classical literature or listening to music from the 70's ,80's and 90's, but we find Progressive House-Music TOP in this 21st century ;)

As a rule,  you will interact with us during the booking process, preparation of your trip and assistance while your stay in. 
-In Berlin we have a property-meager on site who will meet you at Check-in & Check-out and will look after you - only if you need so, as you will be totally free during your stay - while you are visiting  / exploring the city.

Siamo come lo Yin e lo Yang. 
-Paolo è un sognatore, ma molto con i piedi per terra, scrupoloso, preciso, sincero, attento ai dettagli .. qualcuno dice anche troppo maniaco. 
-Valentino laureato in filosofia è una persona aperta al dialogo di qualuncue origine / tema esso sia, ha una mentalità molto pratica, ama interessersi di tutto  dalle più piccole notizie alla più grandi e questo grande interesse a volte lo porta ad'essere soprannominato dagli amici più cari: (Hidden by Airbnb) ;)

Paolo ha quasi 30 anni di esperienza nel settore alberghiero, ama la fotografia cimentandosi a fotografare le sue opere, oggetti creati con materiali riciclati, in particolare  lampade e tutto ciò che ha a che fare con la luce. Orgogliosamente  fieri per avere integrato nelle nostre proprietà  alcune delle sue opere.

Siamo entrambi un po 'vintage: leggendo letteratura classica o ascoltando musica degli anni '70, '80 e '90, ma in questo 21 ° secolo troviamo la Progressive House-Music al TOP;)

Di regola, interagirai con noi durante il processo di prenotazione, preparazione del viaggio e assistenza durante il tuo soggiorno.
-A Berlino abbiamo un gestore di proprietà sul posto che ti incontrerà al Check-in e Check-out e si prenderà cura di te - solo se ne hai bisogno, dato che sarai totalmente libero durante il tuo soggiorno - mentre stai visitando e esplorando la città.
-In Palermo utilizziamo un diverso sistema di Self Check-in e Self Check-out. Ma se hai bisogno di assistenza o in caso d'emergenza anche qui, il nostro assistente fidato sul posto può prendersi cura di te.

Uno speciale ""Grazie"" va a tutti gli ospiti, che hanno già soggiornato nei nostri appartamenti. Il loro feedback ha migliorato le nostre proprietà, di volta in volta per essere sempre di qualità migliore. 

Vi auguriamo un piacevole e rilassante soggiorno nelle nostre proprietà, ma per favore non dimenticate di visitare le città così eccitanti e stimolanti là fuori;)

The room available is a large, white double room, which looks out on our little balcony. The room is cool in the summer months and is incredibly cosy and warm in winter. The apartment is quite old and has a few quirks to it. The shower is old-school German in that it is a hand held ordeal. There isn't a clip to hand the shower head basically (and no way to fashion one – trust us, we've tried!) but once you get the hang of it, it becomes normal pretty quickly.  The floors are quite squeaky too but as long as you're not stomping around we're very used to the general squeaks so don't worry about making noise if you come home after we're already in bed.

I studied Biology in Munich where I grew up. But after a while I thought it would be nice for a change. So I decided to move to the capital of Germany, Berlin, 8 years ago, which I now can call my home. I just fell in love with this multicultural city.

I used to do a lot of capoeira when I was younger and now still do lots of sports. I play the guitar from time to time. Additionally I love the outdoors, mountains but as well as meeting people for a decent self made dinner with a wine and tasty food. I m a ambitious amateur chef though I can never learn enough.

I also love to travel and meet other local people around the world. I enjoyed to go off the beaten treck the last years and stayed in cozy apartments more then in expensive, boring hotels.
I used to do couch surfing for a while and I collected a lot experience as a host.

I would describe myself as an easy going person, happy and curious to learn new stuff about this world. Always up for a good talk.

I moved to Berlin in 2012 to reunite with my husband who was born and raised in Berlin. Although i am homesick from time to time, Berlin's multicultural and hipness has made me feel at home. Experiencing seasonal changes was the most amazing encounter when i moved to Berlin. My best seasons are summer and spring. Nothing beats the spring flowery smell in the Air, i call it coming to life, summer is not only about the sun but also about the joys it brings along, grills, soaking in the lake and the sun, open air events, chilling by the spree, Music, open air movies. Always wish summer would never end .
I enjoy travelling the world, so far my favorite countries are Kenya, Belgium, France, Spain - Canary Islands, Tanzania . During my travels, i always slept in Hotels until i visited Paris where i had my first AIrbnb encounter. We had a great host, who made our stay quite enjoyable. Since then, i have always wanted to be a host, to give back the experience i had to someone else. The time has come and here i am. I would like to provide a guest the opportunity to have a homely place away from home, experience the best of Berlin, and hopefully walk away with unforgettable experiences.

The Souterrain flat is special, people think it's dark but it's actually ok. Lots of mostly indirect light is also supporting evening hours. Bikes could even fit in the place as well. I'm really calm, I'll have to work a lot on my art, so I don't want party groups or people that don't have a natural sense for this. The neighbourhood is extremely calm, even though you have a walking distance to the center, the Bergmannstreet, the Tempelhofer airport field park and lots of good restaurants and cafés around. The neighbourhoods are Neukölln, Schöneberg, as been said Mitte (center), Friedrichshain, Prenzlauer Berg- everything is easily reachable.
